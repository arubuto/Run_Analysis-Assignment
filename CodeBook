Run_Analysis.R code book


The assignment is for getting and cleaning data course in coursera data science specialisation.

the data obtained is from
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

the R script created is Run_Analysis.R and the product of the r.script is the tidy_data.txt

dplyr and reshape2 packages were used for the script. the data was downloaded and unziped to a file in the computer,
these were then read into Rstudio via read.table

the followind items were read as data in the Run_Analysis.

features from features.txt
activity_labels from activity_labels.txt

x_train from X_train.txt
subject_train from subject_train.txt and its column was named "subject"
y_train fron y_train.txt and the colunm was named "activity"
x_test from X_test.txt
subject_test from subject_test.txt and its column was named "subject"
y_test <- read.table("y_train.txt", and the colunm was named "activity"


STEP 1: merge the training and test data
STEP 2: extract only the measurements on mean and std deviation for each measurements
STEP 3: use descriptive activity  names to name the activities
STEP 4: Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable name 
STEP 5: From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for
each activity and each subjectwrite the tidy as tidy_data.txt

the following are the variables left after in tidy_data for each "subject" and their "activity". please note that the 
subject and activity are also colums in the tidy_data
